# code2040_api
This was a Tech Assesment I was asked to complete as a part of my application to the Code2040 Fellowship. This challenge was aimed towards assessing my technical abilities. The skills I needed to complete this task were be able to navigate through GitHub, the ability to process/manipulate data from APIs, and knowledge of some algorithms.
